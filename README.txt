Please try to use Americanized English throughout the project.
Don't get me wrong, I hate the Yanks just as much as the next
guy, but for sake of consistency with external libraries (and
just about every programming language ever written), please use
the Americanized spelling whenever applicable. For example: 
'color' instead of 'colour' and so on. If people in every other
country in the world have to code in Americanized English, so
do we. Plus it saves a letter in most cases, which means
smaller project, which means faster uploading and downloading
to and from git. ;)
